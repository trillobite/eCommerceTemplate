<h3>
Welcome to Solice!

<p>
<b><i><style01>W</style01></i></b>e are a startup born out of inspirations, creativity and thought; striving to better the world with far reaching innovations. 
</p>
<p>
As many believe, the world is not the once peaceful place as we recently remember. Global Warming, wars, disease, droughts, government spying, and severe risk of identity theft, have left us feeling a bit under the weather. When one thinks about even the immediate future for humanity, it is easy to see that it is up to us to secure our futures by spreading and promoting the things which inspire us the most. 
</p>
<p>
Solice has made it our business to promote those innovative passions within our products. Our goal is to make the largest impact imaginable by helping humanity secure it's future through the grass-roots level. This move has already begun with the age of the Internet, due to blogging and social media, but we intend to develop even more tools to increase humanities ability to self govern, and operate in ways which the corrupt will have the most difficulty quelling.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is not specifically to make as much money as possible, but to make as much money as possible to pay those who have inspirations, to continue developing their technologies under our roof. Through these modern day activists, armed with the knowledge of science and all forms of engineering, we can return this world into the more peaceful environment in which we once enjoyed.
</p>
<p>
It is those who strive, those who push, and those who never give in, that change our world. Weather or not one wishes to believe it true, it is a fact that industry, and capitalism frees mankind to push us farther into the future. Man deserves to be free, to develop, and think. Within our working environments, at Solice, we support all new innovative ideas, and we believe a capitalist approach is the best way for our products to move mankind into a brighter future. We create an environment which protects the inventor from ultimate failure, so he can place more focus on his product, rather than upon the risks.
